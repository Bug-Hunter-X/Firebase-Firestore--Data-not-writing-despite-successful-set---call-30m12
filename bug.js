In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to the Firestore database even though my code appeared to be correct.  The `set()` method wasn't throwing errors, but the data simply wasn't appearing in the database.  Debugging revealed that the issue stemmed from incorrect data formatting. I was attempting to store a map using dot notation for keys, which wasn't supported.  The keys should be strings.
